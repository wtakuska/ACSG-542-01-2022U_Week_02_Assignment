                        Did you know that snakes don't have eyelids? Instead, they have a thin membrane attached to their eyes to protect them, which is called brille.</p>

                        Did you know that some species of lizards, specifically desert dwelling, are able to go throughout their whole life without drinking water? Don't try that out at home though.</p>

                        Did you know that a turtle's shell is part of its skeleton? It's made up of over 50 bones and includes the turtle's rib cage and spine!</p>
